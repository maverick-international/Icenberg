# Icenberg ðŸ¥¶

### What is it?

Icenberg is an attempt to clean up ACF Flexible content and ACF Gutenberg block templates which often involve a lot of repetition and logic tangled up in presentation (in true WordPress style). 

Icenberg requires ACF Pro and is primarily for internal use at Maverick, although it is easy to implement on any WordPress template using ACF fields. It includes a convenient CLI for generating ACF Gutenberg blocks.

Using Icenberg's methods we can render acf fields complete with BEM classes and settings in a clean(er) OO fashion, while still allowing us to do things the old fashioned way if necessary.

It is designed to be used primarily with flexible content fields and ACF Gutenberg blocks but could also work within other scenarios, in theory.

Note: The `buttons` and `settings` methods rely on Maverick specific setups, we'll make these more generally usable in the future.


### Getting Started

Install via composer:

```bash
composer require mvrk/icenberg
```

make sure autoloading is set up in functions.php - something like:

```php

$composer_path = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/../vendor/';

if (file_exists($composer_path)) {

    require_once $composer_path . 'autoload.php';
}

```
Make sure you have ACF Pro installed. The library also supports [ACF Gravity forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-gravityforms-add-on/) plugin.

The following example takes place inside ACF's the_row() - ie:
```php

if (have_rows('content_blocks', $id)) :

    while (have_rows('content_blocks', $id)) : the_row();

        get_template_part('inc/blocks/block_template');

    endwhile;

endif;
```
Initialise with ACFs `the_row_layout()`

```php

use MVRK\Icenberg\Icenberg;

$icenberg = new Icenberg(get_row_layout());

```
Once that's intialised you're ready to build your flexible content block.

## Using in an ACF Gutenberg Block

since v0.5.0 you can use Icenberg in an ACF gutenberg block, just pass the block title instead of the row layout. 

```php
$icenberg = new Icenberg(strtolower($block['title']));

$icenberg->the_element('quote');
$icenberg->the_element('attribution');
$icenberg->the_element('portrait');
```

### Icenberg Methods

#### `get_element($field_name, $tag = 'div')`

Returns an ACF field as a formatted string, wrapped up in all the divs you need and with any  special considerations applied. Takes the field name as an argument and optionally a tag for the uppermost element. If no tag is set it will use 'div'

```php

$field_name = $icenberg->get_element('field_name');

echo $field_name;

```

#### `the_element($field_name, $tag = 'div')`

As above, but echoes it out immediately.

```php

$icenberg->the_element('field_name');

```
Icenberg is smart enough to know what a field's type is, so you don't need to differentiate, you just pass the field name in.


#### `enclose()`

Enclose is a utility for wrapping multiple icenberg fields in a container div without having to use a ?> anywhere. You just need to pass it a classname (without prefixes as these will be applied by icenberg). So clean!

So for example, in a 'Cta' block,  where cta_heading is a text field and cta_content is a wysiwyg field:

```php

$icenberg->enclose('text', [
    $icenberg->get_element('cta_heading')
    $icenberg->get_element('cta_content'),
]);

```
will generate:

```html

<div class="block block--cta">
    <div class="section__inner">
        <div class="wrapper block--cta__wrapper">
            <div class="block--cta__text">
                <div class="block--cta__cta-heading">
                    I'm a heading, look at me!
                </div>
                <div class="block--cta__cta-content">
                    <p>
                        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>


```

You could also pass any thing else you like to enclose as part of the array, as long as its storable as a variable (for example inserting a `get_template_part()` won't work here because it effectively prints the content).

```php

$random_text = "<span>I am some random text, isn't it wonderful?</span>";

$icenberg->enclose('text', [
    $icenberg->get_element('cta_heading'),
    $random_text
]);

```

Of course life is never simple, so you will most likely need more complex layouts, but icenberg doesn't mind. You can insert it in html if you want to.

```html

<div class="testimonial__corner-illustration_green_reversed">
    <?php if($motif_variation_5_purple === 'orange') :
    $icenberg->the_element('motif_blurple');
    endif; ?>
</div>

```

#### `settings($field_name, $additional_classes)`

Pass in a field group of settings and optionally an array of manually set classes and it will attach them as CSS modifier classes. if you include a text field called 'unique_id' in your group icenberg will attach it as a id too.

Example using settings in  `enclose()`:

```php
$classes = ['banana', 'orange'];

$block_settings = get_sub_field($block_settings);

$settings = $icenberg->settings($block_settings, $classes);

$icenberg->enclose ($settings, [
    $icenberg->get_element('cheese_board'),
    $icenberg->get_element('flame_thrower')
])
```

or in regular php/html

```html

<div <?php echo $settings; ?>>
    ...whatever you want
</div>
```

which will print out something like
```html
"class='orange orange_padding_top_300 orange_skin_purple' id='cheese_board'"
```

Depending on the settings in your group.


## Conditionals

#### `field($field_name)`

you can use icenberg to evaluate fields too, using the `field()` method in conjucntion with the below methods. `field()` takes the field name as an argument and returns the icenberg instance for method chaining.

 ```php
 $icenberg->field($field_name)
 ```

#### `is($value)`

returns true if the value of the field equals the argument to `is()`. You don't need to check for a fields existance before using these methods as they will do it for you and return `false` if they don't.

```php
 if ($icenberg->field('font_colour')->is('red')) :
    $icenberg->the_element('font_colour');
else :
    echo 'oh no';
endif;
```

#### `lessThan($value)` and `greaterThan($value)`

Self explanatory, both take an integer as an argument. Warning: If you use it on a non numeric field it will return false.

```php
if ($icenberg->field('range_test')->lessThan(51)) :
    $class = 'text_' . $icenberg->field('range_test')->field;
    $icenberg->enclose($class, [
        $icenberg->get_element('cta_content'),
        $icenberg->get_element('cta_image'),
    ]);
endif;
```

## Maverick Specific

#### `get_buttons($field_name)` and `the_buttons($field_name)`

Return a formatted button group with a huge range of styles catered for - very Maverick specific.
Expects our usual button group format.

## CLI

you can now use the Icenberg CLI to rapidly bootstrap Icenberg blocks (since v0.5.0). This extends wp-cli so you need to have that installed and working first.

Add the below to your functions.php, after the autoload.

```php
$is_wp_cli = defined('WP_CLI') && WP_CLI;

if ($is_wp_cli) {
    \MVRK\Icenberg\Commands\Bootstrap::setup();
}
``` 

### Available commands

`wp icenberg block --block_name`

this bootstraps an ACF gutenberg block with all relevant files ready to go.

This assumes that your blocks are in a folder called 'blocks' in your template root directory but this is configurable.

Icenberg generates a folder per block withing the blocks folder. This folder contains
- block.json
- <block_name>.php
- <block_name>.css

It will also register an empty field group ready for access via the ACF GUI.

if the `build_src` config option is `true` then a sass partial will also be generated at the specified `sass_path`


### Configurqation
Config options are now available by placing an 'icenberg.yaml' file in your project's root directory. If this file doesn't exist or can't be parsed, icenberg will just go ahead and use its defaults.

Supported config options below with their default values:

```yaml
block_directory_name: 'blocks' #change the default block directory name
sass_path: 'src/sass/blocks' #specify a location for sass partials
build_src: true #whether or not to create a sass file in a specified directory for those who prefer to seperate concerns.
```
